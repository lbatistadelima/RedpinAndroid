ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

From RedpinAndroid:
* default.properties
* gpl.txt
* javadoc.xml
* lgpl.txt
* lib\
* lib\gson-1.3.jar
From RedpinCore:
* .mtj
* Application Descriptor
* build.xml
* gpl.txt
* lgpl.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In RedpinCore:
* src\ => redpinCore\src\main\java\
In RedpinAndroid:
* AndroidManifest.xml => redpinAndroid\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => redpinAndroid\src\main\assets\
* res\ => redpinAndroid\src\main\res\
* src\ => redpinAndroid\src\main\java\
* Test\res\ => redpinAndroid\src\androidTest\res\
* Test\src\ => redpinAndroid\src\androidTest\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
